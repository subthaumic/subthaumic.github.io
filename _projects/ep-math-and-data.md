> This page preserves and curates material from the former STRUCTURES Wiki, captured in October 2025 after the wiki was decommissioned.

The Exploratory Project "Mathematics and Data" (EP Math & Data) brings together researchers interested in the developing interface between topology, geometry, data science, and their applications inside the [STRUCTURES Cluster of Excellence](https://structures.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php) at Heidelberg University and beyond.

A wiki collected introductory material, tutorials and case studies that illustrate how topological and geometric ideas inform modern data analysis, and seminar schedules. 
With the wiki gone, this page acts as the hub for the preserved content.
The material on the wiki was authored and curated by:
Michael Bleher, Lukas Hahn, Freya Jensen, Maximilian Schmahl, and Daniel Spitz.

## Further Material
What began as an informal welcome packet for new collaborators quickly grew into a small library of background material. The following pieces remain the best starting points for anyone exploring the project today:
- **[What is Topological Data Analysis?](/projects/ep-math-data/archive/what-is-topological-data-analysis-a-primer/)** A high-level overview of the field, its goals, and its methods.
- **[Case studies](/projects/ep-math-data/archive/case-studies/)** that explain how persistent homology and related tools surfaced unexpected structure in cosmology, genomics, and materials science.
- **[Guided tutorials](/projects/ep-math-data/archive/tutorials/)** for software such as GUDHI and JavaPlex, together with curated introductory reading.
