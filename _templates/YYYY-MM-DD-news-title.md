This is a sample news item. You can write about recent events, updates, or any other relevant information here.
You can use **bold** or *italic* text, and even include [links](https://example.com) to other pages.
You can also add lists:
- Item 1
- Item 2

For longform (inline: false), you can write more detailed articles, using Markdown syntax for formatting of headings.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

But I recommend keeping it concise and to the point, as this is meant for quick updates.
