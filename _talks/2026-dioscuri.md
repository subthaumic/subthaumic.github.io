abstract:
    The application of persistent homology to viral evolution was suggested some years ago at the example of genomic data of flu viruses. It was observed that long-lived topological features detect reassortment and recombination events, which provide much of the variability of flu viruses. Here, I present a careful investigation of short-lived homology classes in the data, that typically disregarded as noise. Our results show that persistent homology identifies recurrent mutations in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. This provides insights into how distinct viral strains exhibit convergent genomic structures, which is a hallmark of adaptation processes. Moreover, I will explain how our analysis can easily incorporate temporal information despite the general pitfalls of multi-persistent homology. In that way it is possible to monitor changes in convergent behaviour over the course of the pandemic.
