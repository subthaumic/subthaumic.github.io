abstract:
    Understanding cell population dynamics is crucial in stem cell biology and cancer research. Population-level dynamics are often not identifiable from aggregate data alone: many different compartmental models can fit the same observations. Single-cell RNA sequencing with RNA velocity offers a potential way forward by providing information about individual cell states and their transitions. In this talk, I present early work on using Euler characteristic profiles (ECPs) to extract graph topology from scRNA-seq data. By constructing bifiltered simplicial complexes from kNN graphs weighted by velocity alignment, we obtain topological signatures that can distinguish between different underlying state transition networks. Preliminary results on synthetic data suggest that ECPs can differentiate between differentiation graphs, opening the door to testing biological hypotheses about cell state transitions. Joint work with Marta Marszweska, Justyna Signerska-Rynkowska, Pawel Dlotko, Anna Marciniak-Czochra, and Ana Martin-Vilalba.
