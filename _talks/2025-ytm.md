abstract:
    We propose a methodology to construct filtered directed simplicial complexes from the internal states of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Our approach treats ANNs as structural causal models and applies Pearl's counterfactual reasoning to infer directed relationships between neuron activations in a given input context. We argue that the resulting complexes provide a meaningful model of distributed feature representations and offer insights into their superposition at polysemantic neurons. As an initial example, we analyse activation data from a multilayer perceptron trained on a simple classification task, demonstrating how directed simplices capture the network's capacity to isolate and recombine distinct features. This framework offers a principled approach to characterising neural representations, with potential applications in model evaluation and feature disentanglement.
