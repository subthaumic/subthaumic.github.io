Happy to get the chance to travel to Chicago and participate in the [Geometric Realization of the AATRN](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/the-geometric-realization-of-aatrn-applied-algebraic-topology-research-network/), meet me there! I'll bring along a poster about the Mech Interp project on directed simplicial complexes and neural networks.
