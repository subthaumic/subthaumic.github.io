New preprint: **A Riemannian Autocorrelation Function and its Application to Non-Local Isoperimetric Energies** with Denis Brazke and Sebastian Nill is now on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10481). We generalize Matheron's covariogram to Riemannian manifolds using the geodesic flow and prove Γ-convergence results for non-local isoperimetric energies on spheres.
