This is a list of entries to the vastly growing literature in the field of topological data analysis, both from a theoretical and an applied point of view.

## Literature on theory
A well-known theoretical introduction to the field. Carlsson: _Topology and Data_. 

One of the papers introducing the notion of persistent homology of a filtration. Zomorodian and Carlsson: _Computing persistent homology_.

A recently introduced topological summary better suited than persistence diagrams to statistically analyze persistent homology, the persistence landscape. Bubenik: _Statistical topological data analysis using persistence landscapes._

## Literature towards applications
A thorough introduction to the field and approaches of computational topology. Edelsbrunner and Harer: _Computational topology: an introduction_.

A general overview of persistent homology with an eye towards applications of different numerical libraries. In the supplementaries starting points for own numerical steps are given. Otter et al: _A roadmap for the computation of persistent homology_.

The mapper algorithm. Singh et al: _Topological methods for the analysis of high dimensional data sets and 3d object recognition._
