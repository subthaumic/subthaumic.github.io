In recent years there has been a somewhat surprising flow of ideas from the mathematical branch of topology towards applications in the natural sciences. The tale of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has it, that these methods provide a highly flexible, nonparametric approach to data analysis. Indeed, there are by now several well-known mathematical results that make statements of this kind rigorous. However, successful applications of TDA often build on a deep intuition about the system in question and many theoretical aspects of TDA remain active fields of research.

The goal of this seminar is to bring together people from various backgrounds who are interested in TDA. We will have talks on topics ranging from applications of TDA on real world problems to the abstract mathematical foundations of the subject. An emphasis is put on synergies with Machine Learning. In addition, we aim to discuss works, which are inspired by TDA but not employing it directly. Contributions by participants are very welcome!
