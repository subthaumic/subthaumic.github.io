In this tutorial we will learn how to employ the C++ library GUDHI (Geometric understanding in higher dimensions) in order to compute the Delaunay complex and alpha shapes of given point cloud data. For a more complete picture of GUDHI we refer to the project homepage and recommend reading the tutorials provided there.

This tutorial describes the numerics leading to results as in [What is Topological Data Analysis? - A Primer]({{ '/projects/ep-math-data/what-is-topological-data-analysis-a-primer/' | relative_url }}).
